# 🐍 Python Interpreter – Custom Implementation

This project is part of my **Master’s degree coursework**. It involves designing and developing a simple **Python interpreter** from scratch. The goal is to understand the core components of programming language interpreters like **lexical analysis**, **parsing**, and **execution**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build a minimal interpreter that can:
- Accept and execute basic Python-like syntax
- Perform tokenization, parsing, and execution
- Handle expressions, conditionals, loops, and functions

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- Custom-built tokenizer (lexer)
- Recursive descent parser
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation
- Interpreter module for execution

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Variable assignments
- If-else conditionals
- While loops
- Function definitions and calls
- Print statements
